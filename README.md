## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy to Heroku

Make sure you're logged into the Heroku CLI:

```bash
heroku login

Create the Heroku app (only once):

```

If your local Git branch is not named `main`, you can push using:

git push heroku master:main
```

Or update the script in `package.json` to:

```json
"heroku:push": "git push heroku master:main"

[https://heroku-backend-nodejs-XXXX.herokuapp.com/api/v1/expenses](https://heroku-backend-nodejs-XXXX.herokuapp.com/api/v1/expenses)

Replace the domain above with your real Heroku-generated URL.
